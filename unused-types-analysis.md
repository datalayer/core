# Unused Types Analysis - Final Report

## Summary
After thorough analysis of all types in `/src/api/types`, I've identified types that can be safely removed.

## üóëÔ∏è Types that CAN BE REMOVED

### From `spacer.ts`:
1. **`SpaceItem`** - Not used anywhere in the codebase
2. **`CreateLexicalRequest`** - No implementation found
3. **`UpdateLexicalRequest`** - No implementation found
4. **`CreateCellRequest`** - No implementation found
5. **`UpdateCellRequest`** - No implementation found

### From `runtimes.ts`:
6. **`RuntimesListParams`** - Query params type not used (list function doesn't accept params)
7. **`RuntimeSnapshotsListParams`** - Query params type not used (list function doesn't accept params)
8. **`EnvironmentNotFoundResponse`** - Error response type not used (generic error handling is used instead)
9. **`NoRuntimeAvailableResponse`** - Error response type not used (generic error handling is used instead)

## ‚úÖ Types that MUST BE KEPT (even if they appear unused)

These types are components of other used types:

### From `iam.ts`:
- **`MeUser`** - Used within `UserMeResponse`
- **`WhoAmIProfile`** - Used within `WhoAmIResponse`

### From `spacer.ts`:
- **`NotebookContent`** - Used within `Notebook` interface
- **`CellOutput`** - Used within `Cell` interface
- **`NotebookMetadata`** - Used within `NotebookContent`
- **`KernelSpec`** - Used within `Notebook` and `NotebookMetadata`
- **`LanguageInfo`** - Used within `NotebookMetadata`

### From `runtimes.ts`:
- **`EnvironmentSnippet`** - Used within `Environment`
- **`EnvironmentContent`** - Used within `Environment`
- **`ResourceConfig`** - Used within `Environment` and `ResourceRanges`
- **`ResourceRanges`** - Used within `Environment`
- **`RuntimeStatus`** - Used within `Runtime`
- **`RuntimeSnapshot`** - Used within `SnapshotGetResponse`, `SnapshotCreateResponse`, `SnapshotsListResponse`
- **`RuntimeSnapshotFile`** - Used within `RuntimeSnapshot`

## üìä Impact Analysis

### Safe to Remove (9 types):
- These types have no references in the codebase
- No breaking changes expected
- Clean up will reduce code complexity

### Must Keep (14 types):
- These are dependency types used within other interfaces
- Removing them would break the type system
- They provide important type safety even if not directly imported

## üéØ Recommendation

**Remove only the 9 types listed in the "CAN BE REMOVED" section**. These are truly unused and their removal will:
1. Reduce bundle size slightly
2. Improve code maintainability
3. Eliminate confusion about unused APIs

The other types that appear "unused" are actually critical parts of the type system and must be retained.
