/**
 * How long a visitor's trial key has left, burning down as they use it.
 *
 * An anonymous visitor reaches the model on a key the inference service mints
 * for exactly this, and it does not last. Without a clock on screen the end of
 * it arrives as an agent that suddenly stops answering — indistinguishable,
 * from the reader's chair, from an agent that is broken. A ring that empties
 * says the same thing in advance, and turns a failure into a deadline.
 *
 * Every number it draws comes from the key: when it dies and how long it was
 * given are both read out of the JWT by whoever minted it, so this assumes no
 * particular generosity from the service. The points at which it changes
 * colour are shares of that, for the same reason — see `warnAt`.
 *
 * Purely a display: it is handed a moment in the future and counts to it. What
 * to do when it arrives is the caller's business — the ring reports it once,
 * through `onExpire`, and stops.

        Deliberately without the number in it. The countdown re-renders twice
        a second, and a native tooltip is torn down and rebuilt every time its
        `title` changes — so a title carrying the remaining time flashed once
        per tick for as long as the pointer rested on it, which is the one
        place a reader is trying to read something. React writes the attribute
        only when the string differs, so a constant one stays put and the
        seconds are read off the pill beside it.

        A status readout rather than a control, so the hint rides on the native
        attribute: Primer's `Tooltip` requires an interactive child.
