/**
 * What the workspace says when the visitor's trial key runs out.
 *
 * The end of a trial of anonymous inference is a fact worth stating plainly.
 * Left unsaid it arrives as an agent that has stopped answering, and a reader
 * with no account has no way to tell that apart from a broken one — so this
 * takes the workspace's place and says which of the two happened, and what to
 * do about it. The workspace, not the conversation: on a layout whose
 * transcript is a panel the reader has not opened, a message inside the chat
 * is a message nobody sees.
 *
 * The form is `SignInSimple`, the same one the examples and the landing use,
 * rather than a second sign-in written for this panel: a person who signs in
 * here should end up in exactly the state they would have been in had they
 * signed in first.
 *
 * Signing in is enough. The key is read from the IAM store on every render of
 * the chat, so a member's token replaces the dead trial one where it stands —
 * no reload, and the conversation is still underneath.

            the notebook, and a promise it cannot keep is worse than none.

            workspace answer that route — the landing has it in its router and
            the examples shell handles it in `main.tsx` — so the buttons are on
            rather than configurable. A host that adds neither would strand
            somebody who clicked, and that is the thing to check before
            embedding this somewhere new.
