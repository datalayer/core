# PyTorch GPU Workloads + Datalayer SDK Example

This example demonstrates how to leverage GPU acceleration for computationally intensive PyTorch workloads using the Datalayer SDK, showcasing significant performance improvements over CPU-only execution.

## Overview

This example showcases:

- **GPU Acceleration**: High-performance computing workloads utilizing CUDA-enabled GPUs
- **Datalayer SDK**: Integration with Datalayer's runtime environment for AI workloads
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Side-by-side comparison of CPU vs GPU execution times
- **PyTorch Integration**: Optimized matrix operations and tensor computations
- **Heavy Workload Processing**: Large-scale matrix multiplications demonstrating GPU advantages

## Features

- ✅ Execute compute-intensive PyTorch operations on GPU and CPU
- ✅ Benchmark and compare performance between CPU and GPU execution
- ✅ Demonstrate significant speedup with GPU acceleration (typically 10-100x faster)
- ✅ Reproducible results with deterministic operations
- ✅ CUDA synchronization for accurate GPU timing measurements

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Datalayer SDK
- Environment access to Datalayer platform

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/datalayer/core.git
   cd core/examples/pytorch-workloads
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Quick Start

**Run the GPU vs CPU benchmark**:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute two comprehensive benchmarks on both CPU and GPU (if available), displaying:

- **Matrix Multiplication**: Large-scale linear algebra operations
- **Convolution Operations**: Deep learning CNN-style computations
- Execution times for both devices and operations
- Individual and average speedup factors (GPU vs CPU)

## Benchmark Results

The example performs two types of heavy computations and compares execution times:

- Large matrix multiplications (10,000x10,000 by default): Measures the performance of multiplying two large matrices, a common operation in scientific computing and machine learning.
- Convolution Benchmark. Deep learning-style 2D convolutions (48 batch size, 180 channels, 640x640 images):

Running the `main.py` scripts results in the following example output:

```bash
