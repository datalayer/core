## Create a new Runtime

You can create a new Runtime using a context manager. This will ensure the Runtime
is started and stopped after usage.

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    runtime.execute("Hello world!")
```

You can also select the Environment for the Runtime, as well as the name and 
time limit in minutes for it.

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime(
    name="my-runtime",
    env_name='ai-env',
    time=10) as runtime:
    runtime.execute("Hello world!")
```

## List available Runtimes

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
runtimes = client.list_runtimes():
for runtime in runtimes:
    print(runtime)
```

## Terminate a Runtime

The following snippet will list all available Runtimes and terminate them.

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
runtimes = client.list_runtimes():
for runtime in runtimes:
    print(client.terminate_runtime(runtime))
```

You can also call the terminate method on the Runtime objects as well.

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
runtimes = client.list_runtimes():
for runtime in runtimes:
    print(runtime.terminate())
```

## Create a Runtime Snapshot

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime(name="my-runtime", env_name='ai-env', time=10) as runtime:
    runtime.execute("Hello world!")
    snapshot = client.create_snapshot(runtime, stop=False)
```

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime(name="my-runtime", env_name='ai-env', time=10) as runtime:
    runtime.execute("Hello world!")
    snapshot = runtime.create_snapshot(stop=False)
```

## List available snapshots

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
snapshots = client.list_snapshots():
for snapshot in snapshots:
    print(snapshot)
```

## Delete a Snapshot

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
snapshots = client.list_snapshots():
for snapshot in snapshots:
    print(client.delete_snapshot(snapshot))
```
