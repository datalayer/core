Runtimes provide scalable compute environments for executing Python code in the Datalayer platform. They offer isolated, managed execution contexts with access to CPU/GPU resources, persistent storage, and environment management capabilities.

## Overview

A Runtime represents a remote compute kernel that can execute Python code, manage variables, and handle file operations. Runtimes are created on-demand and can be configured with different environments, resource limits, and execution timeouts.

### Key Features

- **Isolated Execution**: Each runtime provides a clean, isolated Python environment
- **Resource Management**: Configurable CPU/GPU resources and memory allocation  
- **Variable Management**: Get and set variables across code executions
- **File Execution**: Execute Python files and scripts remotely
- **Snapshot Support**: Create snapshots for reproducible environments
- **Context Management**: Automatic cleanup with Python context managers

## Creating Runtimes

### Basic Runtime Creation

Create a runtime using a context manager for automatic resource cleanup:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    response = runtime.execute("print('Hello from Datalayer!')")
    print(response.stdout)  # Output: Hello from Datalayer!
```

### Advanced Runtime Configuration

Configure runtime with specific environment, name, and timeout:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime(
    name="my-ai-runtime",
    environment="python-gpu-env",  # Use GPU environment
    timeout=30  # 30 minute timeout
) as runtime:
    # Execute machine learning code
    code = """
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
data = pd.DataFrame({'values': np.random.randn(100)})
print(f"Generated dataset with {len(data)} rows")
    """
    response = runtime.execute(code)
    print(response.stdout)
```

### Creating Runtime from Snapshot

Restore a runtime from a previously saved snapshot:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime(
    name="restored-runtime",
    environment="python-cpu-env",
    snapshot_name="my-saved-snapshot"  # Restore from snapshot
) as runtime:
    # Runtime starts with the state from the snapshot
    runtime.execute("print('Restored runtime is ready!')")
```

## Code Execution

### Execute Code Strings

Run Python code directly as strings:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    # Execute simple computation
    response = runtime.execute("result = 2 + 2")
    
    # Execute more complex code
    code = """
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Sine Wave')
plt.savefig('sine_wave.png')
print("Plot saved as sine_wave.png")
    """
    response = runtime.execute(code)
    print(response.stdout)
```

### Execute Python Files

Execute entire Python files remotely:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    # Execute a local Python file on the remote runtime
    response = runtime.execute_file("my_script.py")
    print("Script output:", response.stdout)
    
    # Execute with variable input
    response = runtime.execute_file(
        "data_analysis.py",
        variables={"input_file": "data.csv", "output_dir": "/tmp/results"}
    )
```

### Execute with Output Variables

Capture specific variables from code execution:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    # Execute code and return specific variable
    result = runtime.execute(
        "result = sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])",
        output="result"
    )
    print(f"Sum result: {result}")  # Output: Sum result: 15
```

## Variable Management

### Setting Variables

Set variables in the runtime before code execution:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    # Set single variable
    runtime.set_variable("name", "Alice")
    runtime.execute("print(f'Hello, {name}!')")
    
    # Set multiple variables
    runtime.set_variables({
        "x": 10,
        "y": 20,
        "operation": "multiply"
    })
    
    code = """
if operation == "multiply":
    result = x * y
elif operation == "add":
    result = x + y
print(f"Result: {result}")
    """
    response = runtime.execute(code)
    print(response.stdout)
```

### Getting Variables

Retrieve variables from the runtime after execution:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    # Execute code that creates variables
    runtime.execute("""
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': np.random.randn(5),
    'B': np.random.randn(5)
})
mean_A = data['A'].mean()
count = len(data)
    """)
    
    # Retrieve variables
    data = runtime.get_variable("data")
    mean_value = runtime.get_variable("mean_A") 
    row_count = runtime.get_variable("count")
    
    print(f"Data shape: {data.shape}")
    print(f"Mean of column A: {mean_value}")
    print(f"Row count: {row_count}")
```

## Snapshot Management

### Creating Snapshots

Save runtime state for later restoration:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime(name="ml-runtime") as runtime:
    # Set up environment
    runtime.execute("""
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Create and train model
X = np.random.randn(1000, 10)
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 1000)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Model trained successfully")
    """)
    
    # Create snapshot without stopping runtime
    snapshot = client.create_snapshot(
        runtime=runtime,
        name="trained-model-snapshot",
        description="Runtime with trained RandomForest model",
        stop=False
    )
    print(f"Snapshot created: {snapshot.name}")
    
    # Continue working with the same runtime
    runtime.execute("print('Runtime still active after snapshot')")
```

### Alternative Snapshot Creation

Create snapshots directly from runtime:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    # Do some work
    runtime.execute("""
import torch
model = torch.nn.Linear(10, 1)
print("PyTorch model created")
    """)
    
    # Create snapshot using runtime method
    snapshot = runtime.create_snapshot(
        name="pytorch-model-snapshot",
        description="Runtime with PyTorch model",
        stop=True  # Stop runtime after snapshot
    )
    print(f"Snapshot saved: {snapshot.name}")
```

### List and Manage Snapshots

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()

# List all snapshots
snapshots = client.list_snapshots()
for snapshot in snapshots:
    print(f"Snapshot: {snapshot.name}")
    print(f"  UID: {snapshot.uid}")
    print(f"  Description: {snapshot.description}")
    print(f"  Environment: {snapshot.environment}")
    print("---")

# Delete old snapshots
for snapshot in snapshots:
    if "old" in snapshot.name:
        result = client.delete_snapshot(snapshot)
        print(f"Deleted snapshot {snapshot.name}: {result}")
```

## Notes

- **Context Managers**: Always use `with` statements for automatic resource cleanup
- **Environment Selection**: Choose the appropriate environment based on your computational needs
- **Timeout Management**: Set realistic timeouts based on expected execution time
- **Variable Persistence**: Variables persist within a runtime session but are lost when the runtime terminates
- **Snapshot Limitations**: Snapshots capture the Python environment state but not active network connections
- **Resource Billing**: Runtime usage is billed based on compute time and resources allocated
- **Concurrent Limits**: Check your account limits for maximum concurrent runtimes
