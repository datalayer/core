import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

A simple, intuitive SDK for AI engineers to work with the Datalayer platform. This SDK provides a unified interface for authentication, runtime creation, and code execution in Datalayer environments.

## Features

- **Simple Authentication**: Easy token-based authentication with environment variable support
- **Runtime Management**: Create and manage compute runtimes (CPU/GPU) for code execution
- **Notebook Integration**: Collaborative notebook editing and cell execution
- **Async Support**: Full async/await support for non-blocking operations
- **Context Managers**: Clean resource management with Python context managers

## Installation

```bash
pip install datalayer_core
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Authentication

Set your Datalayer token as an environment variable:

```bash
export DATALAYER_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

Or pass it directly to the SDK:

```python
from datalayer import DatalayerSDK

client = DatalayerClient(token="your-token-here")

# Verify authentication
if client.authenticate():
    print("Successfully authenticated!")
```

### 2. Execute Code in a Runtime

```python
from datalayer_sdk import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()

# Create and use a runtime
code = '''import os
from platform import node
print(f"Hey {os.environ.get('USER', 'John Smith')} from {node()}.")'''

with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    result = runtime.execute(code)
    print(result)
```
