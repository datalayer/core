import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

A simple, intuitive SDK for AI engineers to work with the [Datalayer platform](https://datalayer.app/).

This SDK provides a unified interface for authentication, runtime creation, and
code execution in Datalayer Runtimes.

## Features

- **Simple Authentication**: Easy token-based authentication with environment variable support
- **Runtime Management**: Create and manage compute runtimes (CPU/GPU) for code execution
- **Runtime Snapshot Management**: Create and manage compute snapshots of your runtimes
- **Context Managers**: Clean resource management with Python context managers

## Installation

```bash
pip install datalayer_core
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Authentication

Set your Datalayer token as an environment variable:

```bash
export DATALAYER_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

Or pass it directly to the SDK:

```python
from datalayer import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient(token="your-token-here")
if client.authenticate():
    print("Successfully authenticated!")
```

### 2. Execute Code in a Runtime

You can use a context manager to create a Runtime and ensure it is correctly terminated
after code execution.

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    response = runtime.execute("Hello world!")
    print(response.stdout)
```

### 3. Save a Runtime Snapshot

TODO

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    response = runtime.execute("a = 123")
    print(response.stdout)
    snapshot = runtime.create_snapshot(stop=False)
    print(snapshot)
```

### 4. Set Secrets

TODO

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()
created_secret = client.create_secret(
    name="MY_SECRET",
    description="This is a test secret",
    value="super_secret_value!",
)
print(created_secret)

# Use your secret!
with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    response = runtime.execute("import os;print(len(os.environ["MY_SECRET"]))")
    print(response.stdout)
```
