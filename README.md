## Overview

Datalayer Core is the foundational package that powers the [Datalayer AI Platform](https://datalayer.app/). It provides both a Python SDK and Command Line Interface (CLI) for AI engineers, data scientists, and researchers to seamlessly integrate scalable compute runtimes into their workflows.

This package serves as the base foundation used by many other Datalayer packages, containing core application classes, configuration, and unified APIs for authentication, runtime management, and code execution in cloud-based environments.

## Key Features

- **üîê Simple Authentication**: Easy token-based authentication with environment variable support
- **‚ö° Runtime Management**: Create and manage scalable compute runtimes (CPU/GPU) for code execution
- **üì∏ Snapshot Management**: Create and manage compute snapshots of your runtimes for reproducible environments
- **üîí Secrets Management**: Securely handle sensitive data and credentials in your workflows
- **üêç Python SDK**: Programmatic access to Datalayer platform with context managers and clean resource management
- **üêç TypeScript SDK**: Programmatic access to Datalayer platform with context managers and clean resource management
- **üíª Command Line Interface**: CLI tools for managing runtimes, snapshots, and platform resources
- **üîß Base Classes**: Core application classes and configuration inherited by other Datalayer projects

## Installation

Install Datalayer Core using pip:

```bash
pip install datalayer-core
```

For development installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datalayer/core.git
cd core
pip install -e .[test]
```

## Quick Start with Python

### 1. Authentication

Set your Datalayer token as an environment variable:

```bash
export DATALAYER_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

Or pass it directly to the SDK:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

# Using environment variable
client = DatalayerClient()

# Or pass token directly
client = DatalayerClient(token="your-token-here")

if client.authenticate():
    print("Successfully authenticated!")
```

### 2. Execute Code in a Runtime

Use context managers to create runtimes and ensure proper resource cleanup:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()

# Execute code in a managed runtime
with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    response = runtime.execute("print('Hello from Datalayer!')")
    print(response.stdout)
```

### 3. Using the CLI

The CLI provides command-line access to Datalayer platform features:

```bash
# List available runtimes
datalayer runtime list

# Create a new runtime
datalayer runtime create ai-env --given-name my-runtime-123

# Execute a script in a runtime
datalayer runtime exec my-script.py --runtime <runtime-id>

# Create a snapshot from a runtime but do not terminate the runtime
datalayer snapshots create <pod-name> my-snapshot 'AI work!' False
```

## Platform Integration

Datalayer adds AI capabilities and scalable compute runtimes to your development workflows. The platform is designed to seamlessly integrate into your existing processes and supercharge your computations with the processing power you need.

Key platform features accessible through this SDK and CLI:

- **Remote Runtimes**: Execute code on powerful remote machines with CPU, RAM, and GPU resources
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Access and consume runtimes through Python SDK, CLI, or other integrated tools
- **Scalable Compute**: Dynamically scale your computational resources based on workload requirements
