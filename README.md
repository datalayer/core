## Overview

Datalayer Core is the foundational package that powers the [Datalayer AI Platform](https://datalayer.app/). It provides both a Python SDK and Command Line Interface (CLI) for AI engineers, data scientists, and researchers to seamlessly integrate scalable compute runtimes into their workflows.

This package serves as the base foundation used by many other Datalayer packages, containing core application classes, configuration, and unified APIs for authentication, runtime management, and code execution in cloud-based environments.

## Key Features

- **🔐 Simple Authentication**: Easy token-based authentication with environment variable support
- **⚡ Runtime Management**: Create and manage scalable compute runtimes (CPU/GPU) for code execution
- **📸 Snapshot Management**: Create and manage compute snapshots of your runtimes for reproducible environments
- **🔒 Secrets Management**: Securely handle sensitive data and credentials in your workflows
- **🐍 Python SDK**: Programmatic access to Datalayer platform with context managers and clean resource management
- **🌐 TypeScript/React SDK**: React components and services for building Jupyter-based applications
- **💻 Command Line Interface**: CLI tools for managing runtimes, snapshots, and platform resources
- **🔧 Base Classes**: Core application classes and configuration inherited by other Datalayer projects
- **📓 Jupyter Integration**: ServiceManager and collaboration providers for notebook experiences
- **🧭 Universal Navigation**: Smart navigation hooks that auto-detect and work with React Router, Next.js, or native browser

## Installation

### Python SDK

Install Datalayer Core using pip:

```bash
pip install datalayer-core
```

### TypeScript/React SDK

Install as an npm package:

```bash
npm install @datalayer/core
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datalayer/core.git
cd core

# Python development
pip install -e .[test]

# TypeScript development
npm install
```

## Quick Start with Python

### 1. Authentication

Set your Datalayer token as an environment variable:

```bash
export DATALAYER_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

Or pass it directly to the SDK:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

# Using environment variable
client = DatalayerClient()

# Or pass token directly
client = DatalayerClient(token="your-token-here")

if client.authenticate():
    print("Successfully authenticated!")
```

### 2. Execute Code in a Runtime

Use context managers to create runtimes and ensure proper resource cleanup:

```python
from datalayer_core import DatalayerClient

client = DatalayerClient()

# Execute code in a managed runtime
with client.create_runtime() as runtime:
    response = runtime.execute("print('Hello from Datalayer!')")
    print(response.stdout)
```

### 3. Using the CLI

The CLI provides command-line access to Datalayer platform features:

```bash
# List available runtimes
datalayer runtime list

# Create a new runtime
datalayer runtime create ai-env --given-name my-runtime-123

# Execute a script in a runtime
datalayer runtime exec my-script.py --runtime <runtime-id>

# Create a snapshot from a runtime but do not terminate the runtime
datalayer snapshots create <pod-name> my-snapshot 'AI work!' False
```

## Examples

echo "VITE_DATALAYER_API_TOKEN=your-token-here" > .env

# Start the examples server
npm run example
```

## Platform Integration

Datalayer adds AI capabilities and scalable compute runtimes to your development workflows. The platform is designed to seamlessly integrate into your existing processes and supercharge your computations with the processing power you need.

Key platform features accessible through this SDK and CLI:

- **Remote Runtimes**: Execute code on powerful remote machines with CPU, RAM, and GPU resources
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Access and consume runtimes through Python SDK, CLI, or other integrated tools
- **Scalable Compute**: Dynamically scale your computational resources based on workload requirements

## Development

### Building the Library

```bash
# Build TypeScript library
npm run build:lib

# Build Python package
python -m build
```

### Setup

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -e .[test]

# Install TypeScript dependencies
npm install
```

### Storybook Component Development

Datalayer Core includes comprehensive Storybook coverage for all UI components. Each component has its own `.stories.tsx` file located next to the component source code.

```bash
# Start Storybook development server
npm run storybook         # Runs on http://localhost:6006

# Build static Storybook
npm run build-storybook

# Run Storybook on a different port
npm run storybook -- --port 6007
```

**Component Story Structure:**
- Stories are colocated with components (e.g., `Button.tsx` → `Button.stories.tsx`)
- All UI components have comprehensive test coverage
- Multiple story variants showcase different component states
- Interactive controls for testing component props

**Available Component Categories:**
- Avatars, Banners, Buttons, Checkout, Confetti
- Context, Display, ECharts, Flashes, IAM
- Icons, Labels, Landings, NavBar, NBGrader

### Code Quality

This project maintains high code quality standards with automated linting, formatting, and type checking:

```bash
# Run all checks (format, lint, type-check)
npm run check

# Auto-fix all issues
npm run check:fix

# Individual commands
npm run lint          # ESLint with React/TypeScript rules
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format        # Prettier formatting
npm run format:check  # Check formatting without changes
npm run type-check    # TypeScript compilation check
```

Pre-commit hooks automatically run formatting and linting on staged files via Husky and lint-staged.
